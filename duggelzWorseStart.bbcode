[b]Worse Start mod[/b], by [b]duggelz[/b].

Your starting ship is broken and unrepairable. Your starting world is random. Maybe a paradise. Maybe a lava world with extreme storms and sentinels. Good luck!

[b]Instructions:[/b]
[list]
[*] Install this mod with the mod manager of your choice.
[*] Start a new savegame.
[*] [[i]Optional[/i]] Start on [b]Custom[/b] difficulty with [b]Tutorial[/b] set to [b]Enabled[/b] to make things much harder.
[*] Restart a few times until you get a planet you want to play on.
[*] Deploy your Pilgrim exocraft and start driving!

[b]What This Mod Does Exactly:[/b]
[list]
[*] Your starting planet is a random biome with random conditions.  Can be anything from Lush to Exotic, clear weather to extreme storms, minimal sentinels to extreme sentinels.
[*] Your ship has nothing installed, no useful slots, and cannot be repaired or flown.  But you can take shelter in it, and use it to save your game.
[*] You know how to build the Pilgrim exocraft bay, and you have one in your inventory.  The other exocraft you will need to research using the Utopia stations.  You can freely pick up and move exocraft bays.
[*] You know how to build the Utopia stations, so you can research technologies without going to the Anomaly.  You start with a Utopia exocraft station in your inventory.  You can build the rest without having a base, but you will need chromatic metal.  You can pick them up and move them after you build them.
[*] You know how to build the construction research station.  If you've installed the [b]Construction Research Unit Updated[/b] mod, you can research and build various upgrades here instead of using the Utopia stations.
[*] You know how to build save points and save beacons.
[*] You get more variety in secondary resources from plants and minerals. This might help you build things that would otherwise be impossible.
[*] By default, the Tutorial is Disabled.
[*] If the Tutorial is Enabled, you won't have a Terrain Manipulator to mine resource deposits.  This can be really rough.  You can potentially mine with exocraft if you have the right upgrades.  Or acquire another multitool with the Terrain Manipulator installed.
[*] If the Tutorial is Enabled, you won't be able to build a base, until you've gotten off the starter planet.  Live in your exocraft!

[b]FAQ:[/b]
[list]
[*] [b]"Exosuit Initialisation In Progress"[/b] If your starter planet doesn't have sodium plants nearby, the tutorial will freak out a bit here. Just try to ignore that message and find some sodium somewhere.
[*] [b]"Research Structures: Archives Still Fragmented"[/b] At a certain point, you're supposed to learn recipes from the construction research station to build your first base. But sometimes it just shows this message and you can't progress. I don't have a solid suggestion for this one yet.
[*] [i]Is it possible to start in a red, green, blue or purple star system?[/i] No, sorry. I haven't figured out a way to do that.
[*] [i]Is it possible to start on a dissonant planet?[/i] Yes, but it is extremely rare.
[*] [i]Is it possible to start in an outlaw system?[/i] No, sorry. I haven't figured out a way to do that.

[b]Bugs:[/b]

Unquestionably. Let me know in the comments what you find. Please give me information like what platform you're running, what other mods you're running, and anything else you can think of. I'm making this mod instead of doing taxes, so I may or may not be have time to figure out a fix.
